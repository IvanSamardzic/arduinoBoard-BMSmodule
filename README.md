Arduino Uno R3 Battery Management System Module
-----------------

The goal of this project is to design, sketch and program a simple pcb board that is used as an extension board for an Arduino Uno microcontroller. Each item or element within the electronic circuit is explained in detail.

Problem
-------
A DIY Powerwall is the DIY construction of a pack of battery cells to create an energy store which can be used via inverters to power electrical items in the home. Generally cells are salvaged/second hand, and typically use Lithium 18650 cells.

Lithium batteries need to be kept at the same voltage level across a parallel pack. This is done by balancing each cell in the pack to raise or lower its voltage to match the others.

Existing balancing solutions are available in the market place, but at a relatively high cost compared to the cost of the battery bank, so this project is to design a low-cost, simple featured BMS/balancer.

A large number of people have utilised the commercial BATRIUM BMS system in their powerwall devices.
